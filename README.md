This repository demonstrates a common error and its solution when dealing with empty lists in Python calculations.  The `bug.py` file shows the flawed approach that may lead to errors, while `bugSolution.py` presents a robust, error-free solution. The issue stems from attempting to calculate an average from an empty list, which leads to a division by zero error. The solution introduces a check for an empty list before performing the calculation, returning 0 if the list is empty to prevent this error.
